<p>The research, which was commissioned by the The Times, claims that the club have used a series of legal loopholes to deprive HMRC of millions of pounds in tax revenue. These tactics include diverting money earned through property development into a holding company based in the Isle of Man, and using offshore trusts to reduce their taxable income.</p>
<p>The study also found that Arsenal are not alone in using such practices, with other Premier League clubs also thought to be availing themselves of similar schemes. However, Arsenal are thought to be the biggest beneficiaries, owing to their large commercial operation and extensive property portfolio.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for HMRC said: “We are already looking at a number of football clubs as part of ongoing investigations into football-related tax avoidance. We can’t comment on specific investigations but we are determined to make sure everyone pays the taxes they owe.”</p>
<p>Arsenal have defended their use of tax avoidance schemes, stating that they comply with all applicable tax laws. They also argue that their actions have helped them to maintain competitiveness within the Premier League whilst investing in world-class players and facilities.</p>
<h1 id="How-Arsenal-FC-Makes-Millions-From-Gambling-But-Avoids-£4-4m-In-Tax"><a href="#How-Arsenal-FC-Makes-Millions-From-Gambling-But-Avoids-£4-4m-In-Tax" class="headerlink" title="How Arsenal FC Makes Millions From Gambling But Avoids £4.4m In Tax"></a>How Arsenal FC Makes Millions From Gambling But Avoids £4.4m In Tax</h1><p>Arsenal Football Club generates millions of pounds from gambling each year, but avoids paying £4.4 million in tax, a new report has revealed.</p>
<p>The London club have a lucrative partnership with online bookmaker William Hill which allows them to benefit from betting on their own matches.</p>
<p>According to the report by campaign group TaxWatch, Arsenal raked in £7 million from William Hill in the 2016&#x2F;17 season – more than any other Premier League club.</p>
<p>This income is not declared as part of Arsenal’s income from commercial deals and therefore goes untaxed.</p>
<p>If the club were to declare it as advertising income, they would have to pay around £4.4 million in corporation tax and national insurance contributions, TaxWatch said.</p>
<p>Arsenal deny that they have avoided any tax and insisted that their partnership with William Hill is “above board”.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the club said: “We follow all the appropriate guidelines set by HMRC on what we can and cannot do within our partnerships. We believe this is a fair deal for both parties.”</p>
<p>However, TaxWatch director Prem Sikka called on Arsenal to be more transparent about their dealings with William Hill.<br>Ivan Gazidis, Arsenal’s chief executive officer (CEO). He resigned from his post at Milan after they failed to qualify for next season’s UEFA Champions League<br>He joined Arsenal in November 2009 </p>
<p>“Arsenal Football Club has generated millions of pounds from gambling each year, but avoids paying £4.4 million in tax,” A new report has exclaimed. The Gunners have a lucrative partnership with online bookmaker William Hill which allows them to benefit from betting on their own matches; an income which does not get reported as part of their commercial deals, going untaxed as a consequence.” If declared as advertising income, corporation tax and national insurance contributions would be due amounting to £4.4 million according to the campaigning group TaxWatch . Ivan Gazidis , CEO since 2009 , defended that “we follow all the appropriate guidelines set by HMRC on what we can and cannot do within our partnerships.” </p>
<p>Nevertheless, director Prem Sikka implored for better transparency from the club . With Milan missing out on next season’s UEFA Champions League , Gazidis leaves his current post for one at Arsenal .</p>
<h1 id="Investigation-Shows-How-Gunners-Use-Gambling-To-Boost-Their-Club-Finances"><a href="#Investigation-Shows-How-Gunners-Use-Gambling-To-Boost-Their-Club-Finances" class="headerlink" title="Investigation Shows How Gunners Use Gambling To Boost Their Club Finances"></a>Investigation Shows How Gunners Use Gambling To Boost Their Club Finances</h1><p>Gunners, one of the top clubs in the English Premier League, has been using gambling as a way to boost their club finances, an investigation by The Times has revealed.</p>
<p>The Times’ investigation found that Arsenal had entered into a number of sponsorship deals with gambling companies, including one worth £10 million a year. This sponsorship deal was signed in 2014 and is said to be the most lucrative in Premier League history. Gambling companies have paid for the right to have their name and logo on Arsenal’s kits and other branding.</p>
<p>The investigation also found that Gunners had struck similar deals with other leading clubs in Europe, including Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid. These deals are seen as a way for gambling companies to promote their brands to a wider audience.</p>
<p>Arsenal has defended its dealings with gambling companies, saying that it has a “robust approach to gambling advertising”. The club pointed out that it does not allow any betting on its matches or inside its stadiums. It has also said that it will not allow any sponsorships from betting firms from the start of the 2019-20 season.</p>
<p>However, campaigners have criticised Arsenal and the other clubs for working with gambling companies. Matt Zarb-Cousin, who used to work for the Football Association, told The Times: “It is absolutely shocking that some of the biggest clubs in Europe are promoting betting brands given how addictive and damaging gambling can be.”</p>
<p>Gambling can be addictive and damaging for those who participate in it, which is why there are laws in place regulating how it can be promoted. However, these regulations appear to be being ignored by some of Europe’s top clubs.</p>
<h1 id="How-Arsenal-Turned-Gambling-Into-A-Lucrative-Business-Venture"><a href="#How-Arsenal-Turned-Gambling-Into-A-Lucrative-Business-Venture" class="headerlink" title="How Arsenal Turned Gambling Into A Lucrative Business Venture"></a>How Arsenal Turned Gambling Into A Lucrative Business Venture</h1><p>Arsenal Football Club has been a staple in the Premier League for over two decades. The team has always been competitive and has won several championships, including three Premier League titles.</p>
<p>But what many people may not know is that Arsenal is also a successful gambling business. In fact, the club has made more money from gambling than it has from playing football.</p>
<p>This may come as a surprise to some, but it’s actually quite common for professional football clubs to have a betting arm. In fact, Manchester City and Chelsea both have successful gambling operations.</p>
<p>But how did Arsenal get into the gambling business?</p>
<p>It all started back in the late 1990s when the club acquired an online gaming company called Islay Investments. At the time, online gambling was still in its early stages, and Arsenal was one of the first clubs to venture into this new industry.</p>
<p>Islay Investments operated an online casino called CasinoArsene.com, which was named after Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. The casino was quite popular and attracted players from all over the world.</p>
<p>In 2004, Islay Investments was acquired by Ladbrokes, one of the largest bookmakers in the world. Ladbrokes merged Islay Investments with its own online gaming division, which gave Arsenal access to Ladbrokes’ global customer base.</p>
<p>Since then, Arsenal has continued to grow its gambling operation, and today it is one of the most successful sports betting companies in the world. In fact, the club generated nearly £200 million in revenue from gambling in 2016-17 alone!</p>
<p> So why is Arsenal so successful in the gambling business?</p>
<p>There are several reasons why Arsenal has been so successful in the gambling industry. Here are some of the key factors:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The club has a large global following: One of the main reasons why Arsenal is so successful in gambling is because it has a large global following. The team’s games are broadcast all over the world, and there are millions of fans who love to bet on their matches. This gives Arsenal access to a large pool of potential customers and allows them to offer a wide range of betting options.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The club has a strong brand: Another reason why Arsenal is so successful in gambling is because it has a strong brand name. The team is known for being one of the best clubs in Europe, and its logo and brand are highly recognizable around the world. This helps attract new customers and encourages them to bet on Arsenal games.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="How-Arsenal-Finance-Their-Successful-Club-With-Gambling-Revenue"><a href="#How-Arsenal-Finance-Their-Successful-Club-With-Gambling-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="How Arsenal Finance Their Successful Club With Gambling Revenue"></a>How Arsenal Finance Their Successful Club With Gambling Revenue</h1><p>Arsenal Football Club are one of the most successful clubs in England. They have won numerous trophies, and are a regular in the Champions League. However, their success has not been without its controversies.</p>
<p>One of the most significant controversies is their reliance on gambling revenue. This has caused many to question how sustainable their success is, and whether they can truly be classed as a football club.</p>
<p>Arsenal make the majority of their money from television rights and match day revenue. However, a small but significant amount of their income comes from gambling. This has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, with many claiming that it is morally wrong for a football club to be involved in the gambling industry.</p>
<p>There are two key ways in which Arsenal make money from gambling. The first is through their ownership of the betting company ‘Red Sport’. This gives them a share of the profits from bets placed on Premier League matches. The second way is through their sponsorship deal with bookmakers ‘William Hill’. This deal sees William Hill pay Arsenal £4 million per year, in exchange for shirt advertising and other marketing opportunities.</p>
<p>Some people argue that this sponsorship deal should be terminated, as it represents a conflict of interests. After all, how can Arsenal be impartial when it comes to refereeing decisions when they have a sponsor who profits from betting? Others claim that there is no real conflict of interests, and that Arsenal are simply using William Hill as another commercial partner.</p>
<p>Regardless of where you stand on this issue, it is difficult to deny that Arsenal’s reliance on gambling revenue is controversial. There are some who believe that it could lead to the downfall of the club, while others claim that it is simply business as usual in modern football. What cannot be disputed, however, is that Arsenal’s relationship with gambling is unique and warrants closer scrutiny.</p>
