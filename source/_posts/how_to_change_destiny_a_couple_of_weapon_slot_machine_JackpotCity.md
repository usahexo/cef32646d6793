Destiny 2 is a popular online multiplayer game that features a wide range of weapons that players can use to fight their enemies.

However, players may want to change their weapons slots depending on their gameplay preferences or missions they are about to embark on.

## Step 1: Open your character inventory

The first step to changing your weapon slot is to open your character inventory. To do this, simply press the "options" button on your controller or the "escape" key on your keyboard. This will bring up the menu for your character.
