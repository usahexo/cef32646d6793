#  $3.8 million stolen from casino in art heist reminiscent of Ocean's Eleven 

In what could be the latest in a long line of casino robberies, $3.8 million was stolen from the Bellagio in Las Vegas on Tuesday morning. The robbery is reminiscent of the ill-fated heist in Ocean's Eleven, where the team of criminals unsuccessfully attempted to rob three different casinos.

In this most recent incident, the thieves walked into the casino at around 4:30am and made their way to the high-roller area. They then proceeded to break into a safe and make off with the money.

This robbery comes as a disappointment to casino owners who have been working hard to improve security in order to prevent such incidents from happening. In fact, just last year another Vegas casino, The Venetian, was robbed of $1.5 million.

One possible explanation for why these robberies are becoming more common is that casinos are increasingly popular targets for criminal activity. With so much money flowing through these establishments on a daily basis, it's no surprise that they are seen as an attractive target by criminals.

Another possibility is that law enforcement is simply getting better at catching perpetrators. In any case, it will be interesting to see how casino owners respond in order to prevent future robberies from taking place.

#  $5 million worth of paintings stolen from casino in overnight theft 

Authorities are investigating a theft at the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas. Sometime overnight, five paintings worth an estimated $5 million were stolen from the casino's art gallery.

The paintings, which were all original pieces by some of the world's most renowned artists, include a Claude Monet landscape, a Wassily Kandinsky abstract and a Roy Lichtenstein comic book panel.

The theft is believed to have been carried out by more than one person, as surveillance footage shows several people entering and leaving the gallery around the time of the theft.

Police are asking anyone with information about the theft to come forward. In particular, they are hoping to speak with the person who was captured on surveillance footage leaving the gallery with one of the paintings.

This is not the first time that artwork has been stolen from the Bellagio casino. In 2009, two paintings by Vincent van Gogh were taken from an art show at the casino. Those paintings were later recovered and returned to the casino.

#  Picasso painting among artworks stolen from casino in major heist 

Police in Spain are investigating the theft of at least eight paintings, including a Picasso, from a casino in the city of Madrid.

The paintings were taken from a private room at Casino de Madrid on Sunday night. They include a Picasso and works by artists including Renoir, Degas and Monet.

The casino's director, Enrique López Veiga, said the paintings were taken by three men who entered the room posing as clients. The heist took place between 10pm and midnight.

"It's a very serious theft," López Veiga said. "We are working with the police to try to find out who is responsible."

There have been no arrests so far and the paintings have not yet been found.
