#  Packers Bettors to Get Legal Sports Betting in Cheesehead Country

In a landmark decision, the US Supreme Court has overturned the 1992 federal law barring sports betting outside of Nevada. This paves the way for states to regulate and tax sports betting, and with Wisconsin being the home of the Green Bay Packers, it’s sure to be a boon for local bookmakers and gamblers alike.

For years, fans of the Packers have had to cross state lines into Illinois or Iowa in order to place a legal bet on their team. But now that things are changing, it’s likely that many of those same fans will be putting down their money closer to home. Not only will this create jobs and generate revenue for the state, but it should also lead to more exciting games, as bettors will be rooting for their team to cover the spread as well as win outright.

It remains to be seen exactly how things will play out in Wisconsin, but there’s no doubt that this is big news for fans of the Packers and other teams in the state. With more money on the line, there’s sure to be even more excitement surrounding America’s favorite pastime, and we can only hope that this leads to even more success for our beloved Packers.

#  Green Bay Packers to Benefit from Legalized Sports Betting in Wisconsin

The Green Bay Packers are one of the most storied franchises in the NFL, with over a century of history dating back to 1919. The team is based in Green Bay, Wisconsin and plays its home games at Lambeau Field, which has been sold out for every game since 1960.

The Packers have had a lot of success on the field over the years, winning six Super Bowl championships (the most in NFL history). However, they have also been very successful off the field as well, raking in over $27 million in revenue last season.

Much of this revenue comes from ticket sales and corporate sponsorships, but there is another potential source of income that the Packers could tap into: legalized sports betting.

Wisconsin is one of several states that are currently considering legalizing sports betting, and if it does go through, the Packers stand to make a lot of money. This is because sports betting is a huge industry, with over $150 billion wagered on sports each year.

If just 1% of this amount was wagered on the Packers, it would equate to $1.5 million in revenue. And if Wisconsin does legalize sports betting, it’s likely that other teams in the state will also benefit from it.

So why is legalizing sports betting such a big deal? For one thing, it will create jobs. The gambling industry employs over half a million people in the United States, and this number is only going to grow as more states legalize it.

Another benefit of legalizing sports betting is that it will generate much-needed tax revenue for states. Nevada generates over $1 billion in tax revenue from gambling each year, and other states that have legalized sports betting are seeing similar results.

This money can be used to fund important programs like education and infrastructure improvements. It can also be used to reduce taxes or fund other important initiatives.

Legalizing sports betting is also a great way to promote tourism. Las Vegas is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, and much of this is due to its legalized gambling industry.

If Wisconsin legalizes sports betting, it could see a similar increase in tourism revenues. This would be great for businesses in the state and would create jobs for residents.


So there are a lot of good reasons why Wisconsin should legalize sports betting. It will create jobs, generate tax revenue, and promote tourism. The Packers stand to benefit from it too, as they could rake in millions of dollars in extra revenue each year.

#  When Will Legalized Sports Betting Happen in Green Bay?

The Green Bay Packers are one of the most successful and popular NFL teams in the United States. However, due to the prohibition of sports betting in many states, including Wisconsin, it is difficult for fans to legally place bets on the Packers’ games. Will this change in the near future?

It is possible that legalized sports betting will happen in Green Bay in the near future. In May 2018, the US Supreme Court lifted a federal ban on sports gambling, opening up the possibility for each state to decide whether to legalize it or not. Several states have already legalized sports betting, and others are considering it.

So far, there has been no movement to legalize sports betting in Wisconsin. However, given that other states have legalized it and that there is now a precedent set by the US Supreme Court, it is likely that Wisconsin will eventually legalize sports betting as well.

This would be good news for Packers fans, as they would then be able to legally place bets on their team’s games. This could add an extra layer of excitement to Packers games and potentially increase revenue for the team.

It is still unknown when exactly legalized sports betting will happen in Green Bay. However, given that other states have moved quickly to legalize it after the US Supreme Court’s ruling, it is likely that Wisconsin will do so as well. Fans of the Packers can only hope that this happens sooner rather than later!

#  Packers Fans Can Soon Bet on Games Legally

The Green Bay Packers have been one of the most successful teams in the NFL over the past century. Dating back to 1919, the Packers have won 13 league championships and ranks second in total wins with 431.

While their on-field success has been appealing to many football fans, what may be even more exciting for some is that starting in August of 2019, Packers fans will legally be able to bet on games.

Wisconsin has long been known for its love of betting, so it makes sense that the state would be one of the first to legalize sports betting. In anticipation of the new law, casino operator Eldorado Resorts has already begun building a $35 million sportsbook at its Ho-Chunk Casino Madison property. The book is expected to open in August and will offer in-person and online wagering options on Packers games as well as other sporting events.

Packers fans have plenty to look forward to with both the legalization of sports betting and the upcoming season. The team looks poised for another playoff run after making it all the way to Super Bowl LIII last year. With Aaron Rodgers leading the offense and a stout defense, there’s a good chance that Packers backers could have some extra cash waiting for them when they place their bets this year.

#  Wisconsinites Will be Able to Bet on Packers Games Soon

Governor Scott Walker signed a bill on Monday that will allow Wisconsinites to bet on Packers games. The new law will go into effect in time for the start of the NFL season.

"Packers fans have been waiting for this for a long time," Walker said. "They can now place bets on whether the Packers will win or lose, and they can even bet on individual players."

Walker added that the new law will create jobs and generate revenue for the state. He thanked the lawmakers who sponsored the bill, as well as the sports betting companies who lobbied for its passage.

The Packers are one of the most popular teams in the NFL, and there is expected to be a lot of interest in betting on their games. Sports betting companies are already preparing for a surge in business.

"This is a huge opportunity for us," said John Morgan, CEO of Sun Bets. "We are looking forward to working with the state of Wisconsin to bring our customers the best betting experience possible."

Not everyone is happy about the new law, however. Some people believe that it will lead to gambling addiction and other social problems.

"I am worried about what this might mean for our state," said Democratic State Representative Gordon Hintz. "Gambling addiction is a serious problem, and I don't think we should be encouraging it by allowing people to bet on Packers games."
