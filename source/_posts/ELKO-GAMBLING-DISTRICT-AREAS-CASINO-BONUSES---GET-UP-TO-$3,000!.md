#  CASINO BONUSES OF $1,000 FOR ELKO GAMBLING DISTRICT AREAS

The Nevada Gaming Commission has allocated $1,000 casino bonuses for each of the state’s eleven gambling districts. This move is designed to help revive the regional economies that have been struggling in the aftermath of the Great Recession.

Governor Brian Sandoval praised the commission’s decision, saying that it would help create jobs and stimulate economic growth. He also encouraged casino operators in affected areas to take advantage of the program and offer their customers enhanced gaming experiences.

Commission chairman Tony Alamo Jr. said that the bonus allocation was based on a recommendation from the governor’s office. He added that it was a way of giving back to the communities that have supported the gaming industry over the years.

The Las Vegas Strip and Downtown Las Vegas will not be eligible for the $1,000 bonuses, as they are considered high-income areas. However, casinos in surrounding towns such as North Las Vegas and Henderson will be able to offer them to their customers.
