#  Rules of the Casino Joker Poker Game

Joker Poker is a casino game that is based on five-card draw poker. However, in Joker Poker, players are dealt two cards face down and one card face up. The aim of the game is to make the best five-card poker hand using any combination of the two face down cards and the single face up card.

The game begins by each player being given two cards face down, followed by one card face up. The player with the highest face up card is then given the opportunity to either open or fold their hand. If they decide to open their hand, they must place a wager that is equal to twice their original bet. If they decide to fold, they forfeit the hand and all bets placed are lost.

If the player who opened chooses not to continue in the hand (i.e. has been out-imated), then the next player clockwise has the same decision to make - either open or fold. This process continues until all players have had a chance to either open or fold (or gone all-in).

If there are still active players after everyone has had a chance to either open or fold, the next step is showdown. All active players show their cards and the player with the best five-card poker hand takes home the pot. The following list shows which hands are ranked higher than others:

Royal Flush 


Straight Flush 

Four of a Kind 

Full House 

Flush 
Straight 
Three of a Kind 
Two Pair 
One Pair

#  How to Play Casino Joker Poker

If you're looking for a fun and easy-to-learn casino game, Joker Poker is a great option. This variant of poker is based on five-card draw, and is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. In Joker Poker, the joker is wild, and can be used as any other card in the deck to make a winning hand.

To play, each player is dealt five cards face down. The player then decides which cards to keep, and discards the rest. The dealer also draws five cards, but one is set aside face down (the hole card). The player then compares their hand to the dealer's hand. If the player has a better hand, they win. If the dealer has a better hand, the player loses. If there's a tie, the player keeps their bet.

In Joker Poker, there are several winning hands:

• Pair: Two cards of the same rank
• Two pair: Two different pairs
• Three of a kind: Three cards of the same rank
• Straight: Five consecutive cards of any suit
• Flush: Five cards of the same suit 
• Full house: Three of a kind and two of a kind 
• Four of a kind: Four cards of the same rank 
• Straight flush: Five consecutive cards of the same suit 
• Royal flush: Ace, king, queen, jack and ten all of the same suit

#  House Rules for Casino Joker Poker 

When playing casino Joker Poker, it is important to be familiar with the house rules. The following are some of the most common rules that affect the game:

- In Joker Poker, the ace can be used as either a high (A-K-Q-J-10) or low (2-3-4-5-6) card. If an ace is played as a high card, it is considered to be part of the four of a kind. If an ace is played as a low card, it is considered to be part of the two pairs.

- A player can draw up to five cards in one turn. This includes drawing replacement cards for any cards that were wild during the player's original hand.

- After all players have either drawn or declined to draw any additional cards, the dealer's hand is then revealed. The dealer must have at least a pair of sixes in order to qualify for play. In addition, any other hands are compared against the dealer's hand in descending order (i.e., three of a kind beats two pair). If the player has a better hand than the dealer, then they win; if not, they lose.

Since Joker Poker follows many of the same rules as traditional poker, players who are familiar with poker will find it easy to pick up and play Joker Poker.
