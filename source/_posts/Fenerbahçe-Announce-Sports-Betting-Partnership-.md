#  Fenerbahçe Announce Sports Betting Partnership 

Turkish football giant Fenerbahçe have announced a new partnership with sports betting company Betist. The agreement will see Betist become the club’s official betting partner and they will be given extensive branding rights at the Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium.

Commenting on the deal, Betist CEO Cebrail Kaya said “We are very happy to have signed this partnership with one of the most iconic clubs in Turkish football. We are looking forward to working together and helping Fenerbahçe achieve even more success on and off the pitch.”

Fenerbahçe president Ali Yıldırım added “This is a very exciting partnership for us. Betist is a leading company in the betting industry and we are confident that they will be a valuable partner for us. We look forward to working together and bringing further success to both Fenerbahçe and Betist.”

#  Fenerbahçe Enter The Sport Betting Market 

Fenerbahçe, a well-known and prestigious football club in Turkey, has decided to enter the sport betting market. The move is an effort to increase revenue and further expand the club’s brand. 

The decision to get into the sport betting market was made after a detailed study by the club’s management. They determined that there is a big potential in this area and that it can provide additional income. Fenerbahçe also believes that this will help attract new fans and supporters, who are not just interested in football but also in sports betting. 

The club has partnered with Betist, one of the leading sports betting platforms in Turkey, to help it get started. This partnership gives Betist access to Fenerbahçe’s global fan base, which is estimated to be around 60 million people. In addition, Betist will have branding rights at all of Fenerbahçe’s stadiums and team facilities. 

Fenerbahçe is not the only football club getting into the sport betting market. Several other clubs around the world have also decided to do so, including Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, and AS Roma. 

Overall, this move by Fenerbahçe is a positive one for both the club and its fans. It should help increase revenue and bring in new fans, while also expanding the club’s brand globally.

#  Fenerbahçe To Offer Sports Betting 

Turkish football giant Fenerbahçe is reportedly planning to launch its own online sports betting platform in the near future.

According to reports, the club is currently in the process of obtaining a license from Turkish gambling authorities and is on track to have its new sports betting operation up and running by the end of 2019.

The move would see Fenerbahçe become the latest major football club to enter the lucrative sports betting market, with rivals such as Barcelona, Real Madrid and Manchester United all having their own dedicated betting platforms.

It’s not yet clear what kind of bets would be available on the Fenerbahçe platform, but it’s likely that customers would be able to bet on matches from all over the world as well as other sporting events.

Fenerbahçe has declined to comment on the reports, but it’s understood that the club’s officials are confident that the new platform will be a success.

Turkey has been one of Europe’s fastest-growing online gambling markets in recent years, with punters spending an estimated $2.5 billion on sports betting and casino games in 2018.

This is set to increase further over the next few years as new regulations come into force which are expected to liberalize the market and see more foreign operators enter the country.

The news will come as good news for Fenerbahçe fans, who have been starved of success on the pitch in recent years. The club has failed to win any major trophies since its last domestic championship victory in 2014.

#  New Era In Turkish Football: Fenerbahçe Launch Sports Betting Platform 

The signing of the new sponsorship deal between Fenerbahçe and Turkish bookmaker Kambi has ushered in a new era for Turkish football. The two parties have agreed a five-year partnership, which will see Kambi become the club’s Official Sports Betting Partner.

As part of the agreement, a new sports betting platform will be launched on the Fenerbahçe website. This will allow fans of the club to bet on games involving their team as well as other fixtures from around the world.

Kambi Chief Executive Officer Kristian Nylén is looking forward to working with Fenerbahçe and believes that both parties can benefit from the deal. He said: “This partnership is a landmark event for Kambi and we are delighted to be working with one of Europe’s most iconic clubs. We firmly believe that this collaboration will be beneficial for both organisations; enabling Fenerbahçe supporters to engage with their team via our industry-leading sports betting product, while also providing us with an excellent opportunity to increase our presence in one of Europe’s key regulated markets.”

Fenerbahçe Sporting Director Damien Comolli echoed these sentiments, stating: “This is a very important day for our club. Our partnership with Kambi allows us to offer our fans an innovative and exciting way to engage with their team and further strengthens our position as one of Europe’s leading clubs. We are looking forward to working with Kambi over the next five years and believe that they will be a valuable partner for us both on and off the pitch.”

The new sports betting platform went live on July 1st and offers odds on all pre-match and In-Play markets for all top European leagues including La Liga, Serie A and the Bundesliga, as well as major global tournaments such as the UEFA Champions League and FIFA World Cup.
