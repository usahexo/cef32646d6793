#  How to Take Down the Position Machine Buffalo Tunisia

In the 2010 World Cup, a team of unknowns from Africa shocked the world by taking down one of the pre-tournament favorites, England. This year, Tunisia is hoping to do the same, but they’ll have to get through Germany and Belgium first.

In their opening game against England, Tunisia lined up in a 4-5-1 formation with an attacking midfielder dropping deep to help out in defense. This left striker Zied Jariya isolated up front. The plan worked well early on as Tunisia forced England into mistakes and created chances on the counterattack. However, England eventually adjusted and took control of the game, winning 2-0.

Tunisia will likely use a similar strategy against Germany and Belgium, hoping to catch them off guard and score some goals on the counterattack. Defensive midfielder Mohamed Amine Ben Amor will be key to helping out in defense and launching countersattacks. He’s also been known to score goals, so watch out for him.

Tunisia has a good chance of advancing to the next round, but they’ll need some luck along the way.

You can also target the squares next to your opponent’s king with your other pieces.

Your next step is to develop your pieces. You want to bring your knights and bishops into play as soon as possible. These pieces will be very useful for attacking your opponent’s king.
