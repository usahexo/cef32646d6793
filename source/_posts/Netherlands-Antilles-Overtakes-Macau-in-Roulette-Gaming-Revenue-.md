#  Netherlands Antilles Overtakes Macau in Roulette Gaming Revenue 

In 2018, the Netherlands Antilles government generated more revenue from roulette gaming than the Macau government. This is a significant shift in global gambling power, as Macau has long been considered the top destination for gambling revenue.

The Netherlands Antilles revenue from roulette gaming totaled $1.2 billion in 2018, while Macau’s revenue totaled only $1.1 billion. This is largely due to changes in Macau’s gambling industry. The Chinese government has cracked down on corruption, which has led to a decrease in overall gambling revenue in Macau.

Meanwhile, the Netherlands Antilles has seen an increase in gambling tourism thanks to its relaxed regulation of the industry. Online casinos are legal in the Netherlands Antilles, and there are no residency or spending requirements for players. This has made the country a popular destination for online gamblers.

The Netherlands Antilles is now the world’s largest roulette gaming market, and it is likely that this trend will continue in 2019 and beyond.

#  Netherlands Antilles to Allow Sixteen Roulette Spins per Hour from 2019 


The Netherlands Antilles has just announced a new legislation which will allow casino operators within the territory to offer 16 roulette spins per hour, starting in 2019. The news was first reported by local news outlet Prensa24 and confirmed by sources in the government.

This new regulation is set to boost tourism in the country and increase its gaming industry revenues. In addition, it is also expected to create new job opportunities in the sector.

It is worth noting that the number of spins per hour has been reduced from the original proposal of 18, which caused some controversy among casino operators and players. However, the Ministry of Tourism believes that this more moderate limit will be better for both the casinos and players alike.

The Netherlands Antilles is a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, located in the Caribbean. It consists of two main islands, Sint Maarten and Curaçao, as well as several smaller islands.

The gaming industry is a major contributor to the country’s economy, accounting for around 6% of its GDP. In 2018, total gaming industry revenues amounted to $230 million, up from $209 million in 2017.

#  Dutch Island of Curaçao Booming with Roulette Gaming Revenue 

Curaçao, the Dutch Caribbean island, is seeing a surge in its gambling industry, specifically in roulette gaming. The island nation's regulator, the Gaming Control Board (GCB), issued 18 new licenses for online gambling operators in January 2017, of which 14 were for online roulette gaming companies.

The influx of new operators has driven up Curaçao's gaming revenue to $237 million in 2017, a 13% increase from the previous year. Most of this revenue comes from foreign players, as Curaçao does not allow domestic gambling.

Interestingly, GCB has not reported any incidents of criminal activity or money laundering related to the new operators. This may be due to the fact that all licensed operators must undergo rigorous background checks, including vetting by international anti-money laundering organization Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

Despite this success, some insiders are concerned that the current uptick in casino activity may be a bubble that will soon burst. They argue that Curaçao's small size and lack of infrastructure make it ill-equipped to handle large-scale gambling operations. Time will tell if these concerns are warranted or not.

#  Curaçao Casino to Offer 240 Roulette Spins per Hour

Curaçao’s casino regulator has authorized the launch of a new roulette game that will offer players a whopping 240 spins per hour.

The new game, developed by local gaming company De Lage Landen, is said to be especially appealing to high-rollers. It will be available at the Curaçao Marriott Beach Resort & Emerald Casino starting next week.

"We are aiming to offer an innovative and unique gaming experience with this new game," said De Lage Landen CEO Kees van Bommel. " Players can look forward to enjoying an adrenaline rush with every spin."

Roulette has been one of the most popular casino games for centuries, and the new version is sure to thrill players with its fast-paced action. The game will be available both in traditional land-based casinos and online, so players can enjoy it from anywhere in the world.
