#  Chicago Bears Will Shock The World and Win the Super Bowl

The Chicago Bears have been one of the most surprising teams in the NFL this season. After a disappointing 2017 season, the Bears have come back with a vengeance this year. Led by second-year quarterback Mitchell Trubisky and rookie head coach Matt Nagy, the Bears have roared to an 11-4 record and the number two seed in the NFC.

Many people are writing off the Bears as a Super Bowl contender, but they are definitely not to be underestimated. The Bears have one of the best defenses in the league, headlined by defensive end Khalil Mack. They also have a very talented offense, led by Trubisky, who has progressed immensely throughout the season.

The Bears will definitely be a tough opponent for anyone in the playoffs. They have already beaten some of the top teams in the NFL this year, including the Los Angeles Rams, New England Patriots and Minnesota Vikings.

If they can continue to play well and make it to the Super Bowl, they will definitely shock the world and win it all.

#  Chicago Bears Will Dominate the NFC North This Season

The Chicago Bears had a disappointing season last year, finishing in third place in the NFC North with a record of 8-8. However, this season they will dominate the NFC North.

The Bears have a solid offense, led by quarterback Mitchell Trubisky. They also have a strong defense, which ranked third in the NFL last season in total yards allowed.

The Bears are scheduled to face the Green Bay Packers twice and the Minnesota Vikings once during the regular season. The Packers and Vikings both finished last season with records of 7-9, so the Bears should be able to beat them easily.

The Bears are set to have an excellent season and will dominate the NFC North.

#  Jay Cutler Returns To MVP Form to Lead the Bears to the Playoffs

It was a banner year for the Chicago Bears in 2017, as they completed their turnaround from perennial losers to playoff contenders. Much of the credit for this success goes to Jay Cutler, who finally recaptured his MVP form and led a high-powered offense that ranked among the best in the NFL.

The Bears got off to a rocky start, losing their first three games of the season. However, they then went on a nine-game winning streak to finish the year with an 11-5 record. Cutler was one of the main reasons for this turnaround, throwing 18 touchdowns and only eight interceptions during the team's winning streak.

In the playoffs, the Bears were matched up against the division rival Detroit Lions. Cutler had a huge game, throwing two touchdown passes and leading the team to a 35-14 victory. This win sent them to the divisional round, where they faced off against the top-seeded Atlanta Falcons. Unfortunately, Cutler was unable to lead them to victory in this game, as they lost by a score of 36-20.

Despite this disappointing end to their season, there is plenty of reason for Bears fans to be optimistic about 2018. With Cutler returning at quarterback and one of the most talented rosters in the NFL, there's no reason why they can't make another run at the playoffs.

#  Jordan Howard Named Offensive Rookie of the Year

Chicago Bears running back Jordan Howard has been named the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year.

The 5-foot-11, 225-pound Howard ranked second in the NFL with 1,313 rushing yards and six touchdowns, despite not becoming the Bears’ featured runner until Week 4. Howard was also Pro Football Focus’ third-highest graded running back for the 2016 season.

Howard is the first Bears player to be honored with the award since 2005 (Cedric Benson).

#  Chicago Bears Are on the Rise and primed for a Championship Run

The Chicago Bears are a team on the rise. After missing the playoffs last year, they have made some big moves in the offseason and are primed for a championship run.

The biggest move the Bears made was signing Khalil Mack to a record-breaking contract. Mack is one of the best players in the NFL and is a game changer on defense. He will make an already dominant defense even better and will help them win games.

The Bears also made some other key acquisitions in the offseason, including wide receiver Allen Robinson and tight end Trey Burton. Robinson is a big-time playmaker and should be a major weapon for Mitchell Trubisky this season. Burton is also a very talented player and should be a big factor in the Bears’ offense this year.

The Bears’ roster is stacked with talent and they have all the pieces in place to make a Super Bowl run. They have an elite defense, a good quarterback in Trubisky, and plenty of weapons on offense. The sky is the limit for this team and they could easily make it to the Super Bowl this season.
